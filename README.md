# Tic Tac Toe

## Description

This project is an implementation of the popular game tic tac toe in the form of a web game. The game can be played in single mode or in multiplayer mode. In the single mode the playerâ€™s opponent is an implementation of the minimax algorithm which makes winning impossible.

### User Stories
As an internet user with lots of free time in my hands, I like to occasionally play nostalgic games like Tic Tac Toe online. I often choose the single player mode since playing with an AI can sometime be more interesting. However, I like to play with a friend from time to time using the multiplayer mode. This way, I can pass some time playing something I enjoy.

## Planning and Development Process
    - Worked on making the initial layout.
    - Applied the minimax algorithm and modified it to be suitable for this specific problem.
    - Worked on styling the main page.
    - Added a landing page with a multiplayer option and a few icon options.
    - Finalized the code.


### Problem-Solving Strategy
problems were usually solved with the aid of the information provided by the console in addtion to a few console.log statments that were added when needed.

### Unsolved problems
